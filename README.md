# Healthy Hustle: Smart Habit Tracker for Busy Professionals
## Web app created on lovable.dev where AI software engineer created the whole app structure based on my written prompt.

## Prompt
Build a smart, visually appealing habit tracking web app designed specifically for busy professionals who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The app should support users in integrating sustainable health habits — including workouts, movement, hydration, nutrition, sleep, and mindfulness — into their packed schedules. It should also offer flexibility when workouts aren’t possible by suggesting healthy alternatives.

## App Structure:
### 1. Welcome & Intent
- Start with a warm, professional welcome that speaks to the user’s ambition and lifestyle.
- Emphasize achievable balance: “You can still take care of your health, even on your busiest days.”
- Highlight the key goal: Build a consistent routine with at least 2 workouts/week OR equivalent healthy habits.

### 2. Smart, Personalized Habit Dashboard
Users can choose or customize daily/weekly goals such as:
- Go to the gym or do a 30-min workout (2x/week minimum)
- Walk 10,000 steps
- Drink at least 2L of water
- Get 7–8 hours of sleep
- Take stretch/movement breaks
- Mindfulness or deep breathing (5–10 min)
- Healthy eating habits: choose clean meals, avoid processed snacks, limit sugar intake
- Try a new healthy recipe (1–2x per week for inspiration)

If users miss a gym day, the app gently suggests alternatives: long walk, home workout, yoga, or extra hydration & sleep focus.

### 3. Inspirational Nutrition Corner
- Rotate quick, healthy meal ideas with links or cards showing prep time, benefits, and “why this helps your goals.”
- Provide motivational tips for smart snacking and meal planning during the workweek.
- Optional: AI-generated recipes based on dietary preferences (vegan, high protein, low-carb, etc.).

### 4. Progress, Motivation & Feedback
- Offer positive reinforcement through animations (confetti, thumbs up, motivational quotes).
- Weekly summaries with streaks, visual progress rings, and areas to improve.
- Smart nudges: if a habit slips, recommend a gentle reset or swap (e.g., “No gym? Try a 20-minute stretch session today.”).

### 5. Technical Features
- Modern, clean UI that feels energizing yet calming
- Fully responsive, optimized for fast mobile use
- AI habit suggestions based on past behavior & trends
- Optional: Sync with wearable devices for step count and sleep tracking
- Custom habit templates with reminders and calendar view
